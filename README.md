## Features

- A wordlist loaded from a separate file.
- Displays the word with blanks for unguessed letters.
- Tracks the number of incorrect guesses.
- Win/lose conditions.

## How to Play

- The game chooses a random word from its wordlist.
- The word displays as blanks (e.g., _ _ _ _).
- Guess a letter.
- If the letter is in the word, the blank(s) are filled in.
- If the letter is incorrect, your number of remaining guesses decreases.
- Continue guessing until:
    - You correctly guess the word (you win!).
    - You run out of guesses (you lose!).

## How to Run

To run the game, simply run the `hangman.py` script in Python. The program will prompt you to enter a letter to guess.

## Future Development

- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with adjusted word lists.
- Themed word lists (countries, animals, etc.).
- Allow the player to choose the number of allowed guesses.
- Hints system.
- Visual improvements.
